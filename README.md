This is meant to be used with the Gazebo simulator as set up by Dr. Ian Peake in another repository, as development of this project was done during the COVID-19 outbreak, and physical work cannot be done. The Gazebo simulator was used instead so we could continue working on this project. Ths project has not been tested with real robots, unfortunately, due to the situation.

Ensure that the simulator is running and the navigation stack is running before using any of the action (python) scripts here.
