Hi

To run the gazebo simulator via a sibling container you would need to follow
the following steps:

- download the ubuntu image fo 16.04
- run the image with the following commands:
  sudo docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -it xiro24/dockerdemo /bin/bash

This wil enable the container you just fired up to also use docker. but instead of
doing a docker inside a docker, it just uses a sibling container.

The following method was mentioned in the article below:

If you would like a demo of the product, you can download the
already furbished ubuntu image with gazebo simulators already avaliable to use.
under the path: /home/potato/DemoTurtle
url of docker container:
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/xiro24/dockerdemo
